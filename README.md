Read the README.md to get an overview of project

This is a geomrty calculator which takes INTEGER coordinates and can give the 

1. Dot Product of two three-dimensional coordinates
2. Cross Product of two three-dimensional coordinates
3. Area of multiple coordinates, they must be in clockwise or counter clockwise form
4. Perimeter of multiple coordinates, they must be in clockwise or counter clockwise form
5. Volume of a cube or rectangular prism

Most of these calculations are done by finding the dot product and proceeding to put them into a formula
